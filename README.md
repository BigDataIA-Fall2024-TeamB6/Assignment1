# LLM Cognition
The goal of this project is to evaluate the comprehension capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT-4o. 
This project is influenced by the General AI Assistant (GAIA) dataset and benchmark, developed by researchers at Meta AI, Hugging Face, and AutoGPT.

The framework enables users to:
- Extract data from the GAIA dataset
- Prompt the LLM with the datasetâ€™s predefined prompts
- Collect and rank the LLM's responses
- Re-prompt the LLM in cases of incorrect responses
- Analyze response statistics
